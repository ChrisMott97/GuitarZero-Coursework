## Directories
- .java files should be made in /src/org/gsep
- builds should be saved in /out
- each branch should have appropriately named files
  - select mode main java file could be called Select.java
  - Main.java will be used to collate all Controller classes (i.e. Select.java) and their models
  - this is to ensure when merged, Main.java files don't try to merge
